    "If a web browser can find out it's current location, it would be of great utility in many scenarios. For example, when you order food online, the food delivery company expects you to type in your address.

    "In this lab, We'll create a web page with details of Mr.Watson.\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After this exercise, you will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new HTML document \n",
    "2. Specify DOCTYPE\n",
    "3. Add the head and body elements\n",
    "4. Add a title\n",
    "5. Add a heading\n",
    "6. Add a paragraph\n",
    "7. Add an image\n",
    "8. Create a list of items\n",
    "9. Add a table of data\n",
    "10. Add Links to other pages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a new HTML document**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Open VS Code. On the window to the right, click on the File menu and select New File option\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A pop up appears with title New File, as shown in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Enter \"mywebpage.html\" as the file name and click OK. A file \"mywebpage.html\" will be created for you. Every line of html you write from now on will be saved into this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Specify** All HTML documents start with the declaration. This line tells the web browser that the file contains HTML code. This is not an HTML tag. This line is specified as follows: <!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Add the <head> and <body> elements. Now that we've added the doctype, let's begin adding the html code. An HTML file begins with the <html> tag and ends with </html> tag. The HTML document has a head and a body. The <head> tag defines the metadata about the page, which is used by browsers and search engines. This information may include the document title, character set, styles to be used, scripts etc., Contents of <head> section are not displayed to the user. The <body> tag defines the document body, and contains all the visible contents like headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables etc. The skeleton of an HTML document looks like this:\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Add a title: The title of the page appears on the browser tab, when you open it in the browser. We define it using the <title> tag, which will be added in the <head> section. Now, let us define our document using these elements. Type the below code inside the <head> section.\n",
    "<title>Thomas J. Watson Sr -  Fan Page</title>\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Add a heading to the page: To add a heading, we use the <h1> tag. Type the below code in the <body> section.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Save. To preview your file, you can use Live server. Instructions to preview a file using Live Server:\n",
    "  1. Right click on your file & click on ‘Open with Live Server’\n",
    "  2. This should show notifications mentioning that the server has started on port 5500 & is Live.\n",
    "  3. Click on the Skills Network button on the left, it will open the \"Skills Network Toolbox\". Then click the Other then Launch Application. From there you enter the port no. as 5500 and launch.\n",
    "  4. This will open your file on a new window in your local browser. (Note – If you get a pop-up block alert, please allow pop-ups & do repeat Step 3 again)\n",
    "  5. Click on the file name to view its preview.\n",
    "  6. Add a Paragraph: Now, let's add a short description. The tag <p> is used to defne a paragraph. In this example, we'll add a few lines about Thomas J. Watson. Type the below code after the <h1> heading.\n",
    "  7. Add an Image: <img> tag is used to add an image. Let's add an image of Thomas J. Watson after the heading. To add an image you need to know the image file name and mention it in the 'src' attribute.  The 'src' attribute specifies an external resource that you want to link, such as the URL of an image. You can optionally specify how many pixels the width and height of the image should be. Type the below code after the <h1> heading .\n",
    "  8. Create a List: To create a list of items, we can use the <ol> tag for numbered lists, and <ul> for bulleted lists. Let's add a few more lines of information about Mr. Watson in the form of a list , after the main paragraph. Type the below code after the <p> paragraph.\n",
    "  9. Add a Table: A table is created using the <table> tag. Within the table, each row of data is represented using the <tr> tag. The column or row headings can be specified by <th> element. Finally, each data element within the table cells is specified using the <td> tag. Let's add a heading and a table with three rows and two columns. Type the below code after the </ul> tag.\n",
    "  10. Add Links to other pages: Web pages connect to other web pages and files using hyperlinks. A hyperlink is created using the anchor tag <a>.\n",
    "Once you click on the link the 'href' attribute tells the browser to which web page you should be taken to. Let's create a link to the official web page of IBM from the current page. Within the main paragraph there is a reference to IBM, where we'll add the link. Find the word IBM in the paragraph and replace it with the code below.\n",

    "### JAvaScript: Functions and Prototypes\n",
    "**Functions**\n",
    "+ Is a block of code which can be called from any point in a script after being declared\n",
    "+ Parts of function:\n",
    "  + The keyword function\n",
    "  + The name of the function\n",
    "  + Parenthesis, with optional parameters\n",
    "  + Curly braces, with the logic\n",
    "**Prototypes**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Object instances inherit the properties and mathods defined by the object prototype\n",
    "  + A prototype exists for all built-in JavaScript objects that can be constructed with the new keyword\n",
    "+ Scripts can add custom properties and methods to the prototype\n",
    "+ Scripts can override prototype properties and functions\n",
    "  + These changes affect the current working instances without affecting the static object prototype\n",
    "**Adding functions to prototypes**\n",
    "+ To add a new function to the template for the object, modify the prototype for the object\n",
    "  + The same technique can be used to add or modify object properties at run time\n",
    "**Self-executing functions**\n",
    "+ Self-executing (auto-invocation) functions start running immediately after they have been declared\n",
    "  + The functions and variables are isolated from the rest of the script\n",
    "  + A pattern for avoiding variable name conflicts in the namespace\n",
    "+ Can be an anonymous (unnamed) function\n",
    "+ Often used to initialize data or to declare DOM elements\n",

    "* The Document Object Model (DOM) is a browser-based interface for applications and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of documents.\n",
    "* JavaScript uses the DOM to access and modify web page elements in the web browser\n",
    "**DOM Levels**\n",
    "+ Level 0 - Level 4\n",
    "**Implementations Standards**\n",
    "+ Each browser has varios levels of compatibility with the DOM standard\n",
    "  + Not all DOM API calls are supported in every web browser implementation\n",
    "  + Some web browser implementations exhibit different behavior for the same DOM API call\n",
    "  + The JavaScript engine in most web browsers fully supports level 1, the focus of this unit.\n",

    "**Client-side Window object**\n",
    "+ Window object\n",
    "  + Top of the hierarchy\n",
    "  + Everything in the DOM takes place in a window\n",
    "  + In client-side JavaScript, Window object serves as the global object\n",
    "  + A browser opens a window object on startup, even if the window is blank\n",
    "  + Can explicitly generate a new window with the window.open() method\n",
    "  + Can omit the window prefix from object references, for example, document.write(\"text\") instead of window.document.write(\"text\")\n",
    "\n",

    "**Object Naming**\n",
    "+ To create script references to objects, you can assign a name to every object in the HTML document\n",
    "+ Assign a scriptable reference name to an object with the id attribute\n",
    "  + The id must be a unique name in the document\n",
    "  + The name must appear in quotation marks\n",
